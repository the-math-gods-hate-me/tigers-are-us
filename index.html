                <h2>Tigers Are Great</h2>
                <p>Tigers are majestic beasts, but they can bite your head off. Which in my opinon makes them even better! If I could have one as a pet I would but since they're endangered I can't. </p>
                <p>I hope that some day I will see a tiger in person that isn't depressed, bored and pacing in it's cage. Hopefully if I do meet one in the wild it dosen't kill me.</p>
